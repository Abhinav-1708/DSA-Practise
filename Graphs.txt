Graphs: Nodes/Vertex , Edge
    Directed Graphs
    Undirected Graphs
    Cycles in a Graph (start from node, end at that node)
    1. Acyclic graphs - No cycles
    2. Cyclic graphs - Contains cycles
    Path 
    Degree of graph
        indegree
        outdegree
    (Total degree = 2 times the number of edges)
    Edge Weight


Graph Representation
    // in questions you will be given that the graph contains n nodes and m edges
    // next m lines to give information of edges
    1. Matrix Way
        Space (NxN)
        Adjacency Matrix
            if nodes are marked from 1
                adj[n+1][n+1]
            else
                adj[n][n]
    2. List Way
        Space O(2E)
        List of size n+1 for 1 based indexing
            vector<int> adj[n+1]
